## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

1.) In the case I discover security issues, I would first tell my boss and have a discussion on the severity of the issues and the odds that they would actually end up being exploited. In the case my boss logically proves that these vulnerabilities are hard to exploit and hard to conceive to exploit, I may feel convinced to let this one go as long as my boss vows to change up the engineering pipeline to facilitate the discovery of security issues at an early stage. In the case my boss cannot prove that these vulnerabilities are insignificant but rather wants to cover it up, I will have to take the matter up with a consumer watchdog or the public.

2.) If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU release, ethically it is my responsibility to whistleblow against the company to various whistleblower mediums before taking the matter up to the press. I will make a solid attempt to convince the company otherwise but I may be left without a choice.

3.) If I do not do anything, technically I am responsible for the harm of the results. Yet at the same time, Iâ€™m a junior developer trying to get momentum in my career. Taking the action to whistleblow will put me back in my career. I would need to thoroughly assess the severity of the situation first.
